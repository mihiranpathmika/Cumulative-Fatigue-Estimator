# Cumulative-Fatigue-Extimator
The 20 Si simulation file generates stress fluctuation data while the Matlab code gives the remaining cumulative fatigue cycles. Run the simulation file in simulink and generate the data by rightclicking on the maximum stress graph. Save the file as a CSV file. Then import the same file to Matlab and create the variable with the name 'StressVsTime'. Before running the code, make sure you follow the two steps mentioned in the code itself.
